Lets take the example BT1.height = 3. This means after the root, there are 3 more levels (root height = 0)
Now, lets draw out BT1, but lets reduce the height to 2, and max out the number of nodes possible

                                        x
                        x                               x
                x               x               x               x

This produces a height of 2, but # of nodes is 7. In order to add any more nodes, we would need to drop
down a level since h = 2 is full. This produces the following

                                        x
                        x                               x
                x               x               x               x
      **x**

This proves that in order to reach a height of k, the minimum number of nodes must be log n = 2^3 = 8. Adding
the one node required to bring the height to 3 makes the total # of nodes = 8.

Now that we established that h = log(n), we assert that h >= log(k) due to the following:
n >= 2k -1
which means we can infer...
n >= k
and further...
h = log(n) >= log(k)
...
h >= log(k)
