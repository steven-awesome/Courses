Q2.

/*
    * The algorithm to solve the transforming of tree T1 into tree T2 where both have the same elements is as follows:
    *
    * Build two trees T1 and T2 with same elements but different structure (but keeping the BST property)
    *
    *
    * 1. Check if the trees are empty, and if they are we end the algorithm
    *
    * 2. If T1.height == T2.height, and the T1.root, we can simply end
    *   as they are the same trees
    *
    * 3. Recursively (in post order) traverse both trees
    * 4. If T1.root != T2.root => find T2's root node in T1 and rotate it up to the root.
    * 4-a. => If node is left child, do right rotation on it's parent
    * 4-b. => If node is right child do left rotation on it's parent
    * 5. Call the recursion function and repeat above for subtree of every node visited
    *
