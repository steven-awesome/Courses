    * The algorithm to traverse each edge only once in each direction is based on a Depth First traversal.

    * Create a list L to hold edges
    * Choose a vertex to start at
    * Loop:
    *   Add all white (if any) adjacent edges to L
    *   Mark all added edges as grey
    *   Remove vertex from end of L
    *   If vertex is not black
    *       Traverse edge to next vertex
    *       Mark edge as grey
