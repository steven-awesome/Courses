    * Lemma 8.3. Starting with an empty ScapegoatTree any sequence of m add(x) and remove(x) operations
    * causes at most O(mlogm) time to be used by rebuild(u) operations.
    * Proof. To prove this, we will use a credit scheme. We imagine that each node stores a number of credits.
    * Each credit can pay for some constant, c, units of time spent rebuilding.
    * The scheme gives out a total of O(mlogm) credits and every call to rebuild(u) is paid for with credits stored at u.
